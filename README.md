In a political climate of intensely polarizing takes on the latest scandals, international relations, and national issues, it can be difficult to make sense of all the data. 
This allows the average news consumer to experience a stream-lined information acquisition process, free of any useless repetition.
We intend to utilize an unsupervised learning algorithim to cluster together a data set of news stories by topic, creating homogeneous groups that provide differing perspective on the same story.
We will be coding in Python, using a NLP software (probably Spacy) to disseminate the large bodies of text and derive coherent and comparable meaning (maybe using word vectors).
